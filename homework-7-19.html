Given a string, print the string uppercased. #string #easy
Given a string, print the string capitalized. #string #easy
Given a string, print the string reversed. #string #loop #easy
Given a string, print "<string> is a palindrome" if it is a palindrome, or "<string> is not a palindrome" if it is not. What is a palindrome? 
****Here is a list of know palindromes to test with (you will have to strip out the punctuation and spaces and normalize the casing) <http://www.palindromelist.net/>
Given a paragraph of text, print the number of words in the paragraph. #string #easy
